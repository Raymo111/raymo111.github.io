							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<h3>
								My name is Raymond Li. I’ve always loved technology. To me, technology is much more than using it everyday. It is about how technology has allowed us to evolve beyond what our ancestors deemed impossible, beyond what they could even imagine. Albert Einstein once said that it has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity. There are computers everywhere today. Even a single smartphone or smartwatch today is more powerful than the entire computing power of the Allies during World War 2. However, this gradual evolving of technology was made possible by a select few. Even today, less than half the population knows how a computer actually works. Even though most people use computers and other smart devices everyday, very few people understand the logic behind the operating systems and software that they use on a daily basis. In fact, according to the International Data Corporation, less than 5% of the world’s 7 billion people can code. My father started programming in the days of punch-cards, then MS-DOS and floppy drives changed his life. The technological world has advanced so much since then. In 2006, when I was 4 years old and one year after C# 2.0 was released, he helped me learn it. I didn’t find that language overly useful in the playground, however, so I dropped programming until high school, when I signed up for several computer science courses. In the Spring of 2017, I learned the language Turing. I learned Java that summer, and then C++ the following year. Though I thought I had just started life in the digital world, my journey had actually begun more than 10 years ago when I first entered the then yet to mature world of computer science under my father's guidance, new to the technological world and its limitless possibilities. Every step along the way has only opened up more possibilities.
